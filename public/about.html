                        Calen G Buford was born in St.Louis, Missouri in the winter of 1996, the youngest of 
                        four brothers. His family moved about frequently for the first few years of his life 
                        before finally settling down in Park City, Utah. In his youth, he and his brothers 
                        enjoyed drawing, but as their passions shifted to other pursuits, Calen remained steadfast
                        in improving his artistic talents.

                    <br>
                    <div class="bio-img-text">
                        In his senior year of high school, Calen sold his first piece Above the Rain. Since then 
                        he has taken on 20+ commissioned pieces by individuals and companies. While studying Applied 
                        Mathematics & Computer Science at Brigham Young University, Calen has continued to stretch 
                        his artistic skills by entering new realms of design by creating websites, including this one, 
                        from scratch.

                    <div class="bio-img-text">
                        In 2015 Calen met a fellow computer science student, Spring Cullen, in a calculus class. On 
                        August 17th, 2019 he married Spring in Salt Lake City, Utah. Together they enjoy tackling 
                        programming projects, creating art, hiking, and have set goals to learn the morse code alphabet.
                        Calen looks forward to graduating from BYU in 2021, and eventually pursuing an MBA. Regardless 
                        of the path his future career takes, Calen plans to always keep art in his life as a form of 
                        expression and to uplift others.
